    <pre>Something else that could be useful is writing out manual tests cases you've done so I can evaluate and rerun them.</pre>

    <pre>> However, I'm still very wary of leaving Homebrew with no tests ensuring that it doesn't inadvertently block uninstalling things that shouldn't be blocked.

I appreciate the concern ‚ù§Ô∏è but we'll do some manual testing and you've added some new unit tests which should help here.</pre>

    <pre>As a general comment: this formula is kinda a full port to macOS. I'd strongly recommend workign with upstream to get all this stuff (including e.g. icns generation) upstream and ideally get a .app bundle that they can build and support.</pre>

    <pre>> You should submit them to upstream instead.

Agreed. Upstream need to be willing to support macOS.</pre>

    <pre>> Agree in principle. I might leave one or two for now just to make sure that the options are understood correctly, and move the rest somewhere else. (Although, it sure would be nice if they were just faster ü§î.)

I think it's probably still worth just removing them. Agreed about them being faster but integration tests are always going to be significantly slower so I think we really only want one per command.</pre>

    <pre>Check and see if `assert_match "simple usage:", shell_output("#{bin}/urbit" 2>&1", 1)` works instead.</pre>

    <pre>Thanks for your contribution to Homebrew! Without people like you submitting PRs we couldn't run this project. You rock!</pre>
