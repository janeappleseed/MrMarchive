    <pre>> You don't have to be able to name them, you just have to know what a given method does. If it returns something, use {}, else use do ‚Ä¶ end.

It seems I'm not going to convince you but: to be fair, I don't think I have to here. @jawshooah and I agree here; can we reach some sort of compromise?</pre>

    <pre>> This also increases the chances of UNIX reusing the password.

> Explicitly ask for the root password before starting the installation process, and then feed it to whatever password prompt occurs during an installation.

These two things make the process significantly less secure as now anything else can get unauthenticated root access for the duration of that process.

    <pre>> This is basically like reasoning with ‚Äúbecause it has always been this way‚Äú.

Which for legacy codebases is not an unreasonable or uncommon position to take.


> Could you give an example? I fail to see how you can call something and not know anything about it.

Well, the cop itself says "but exceptions are permitted in the `ProceduralMethods`, `FunctionalMethods` and `IgnoredMethods` sections below". Without looking: could you name each of those methods? I certainly couldn't. 

@jawshooah and I are both happy picking between those two methods so I think it's worth just picking one of the other two options.</pre>

    <pre>Another subjective argument: it's not the wider Homebrew style.

Less subjective argument: it means that it's not at all obvious whether you need to use `do` or `{` without knowing something about the thing you're calling. I get that wrong frequently and working with Ruby is my job; we're trying to attract drive-by contributors here and that's not helpful for them. I should be able to infer from either the fact that I'm chaining or where I put my linebreaks whether I use `do` or `{`.</pre>

    <pre>> That said, again, I don't have strong feelings either way. It seems excluding RSpec and picking the first may be the most agreeable?

@reitermarkus @jawshooah Thoughts on this? Would like to get this PR shipped in some form.</pre>

    <pre>> particularly WIP ones where it's hard to review just the changes each time.

Something that helps this: not force-pushing to WIP branches with lots of changes.</pre>

    <pre>> This is a first step towards being able to merge our test suites.

Can you elaborate a bit more on this as I'm not sure I see it?

As another comment I think with PRs like this it's probably worth having lots of smaller PRs rather than bigger PRs; particularly WIP ones where it's hard to review just the changes each time.</pre>

Yep, that's expected.</pre>
